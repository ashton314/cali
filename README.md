*C*ali's *A*lmost a *L*isp *I*nterpreter

Description
-----------

I would love a little Lisp interpreter implemented in C++ to help me with my school work. I want the following three things at a *minimum* before I'm happy:

 1. Cons cells that get garbage collectedâ€”no memory leaks here.
 2. Recursion. Did I mention I want recursion? See number 2 on this list.
 3. Closures. By implication this necessitates first-class lambdas.

Some nice things that I'm not sure if I'll get around to implementing are:

 - Macros
 - Call/cc conversion
 - Hooks into native C++ code
